I use a modified version of muicss's css file to make it compatible with  (react) Material-Ui's darkTheme and all of their components. The only thing I use MuiCSss for is laying out content. These two links:

- for responsive break points https://www.muicss.com/docs/v1/react/grid
- for aligning https://www.muicss.com/docs/v1/react/css-helpers
